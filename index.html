                <p>This project site serves as a template to clients so that they can have an idea of what they can
                    expect when they hire me to upgrade their websites. I used Pokeplushes as an example to show
                    creativity and versatility, especially from an e-commerce approach. This is one of a few options I
                    would show a potential client to give them some ideas for their final site design and functionality.

                <p>Pokemon is one of Nintendo's most popular and well known game series, among other titles such as
                    Mario and Zelda. However, Pokemon tends to attract a younger audience due to the simplicity of the
                    story and mechanics: gather a team of 6 magical creatures to battle your way through the region and
                    become champion. There are plenty of damage calculators online for Pokémon, but these are typically
                    aimed at more advanced players, giving so much information it would overload a beginner. I was
                    inspired to build a simple, quick, and easy web app that would allow even children to be able to
                    understand how to use it.</p>

                <p>In today's world of digital dominance, it is important to have your foot in the door with a strong
                    web facing presence. Wanderlust reached out to me looking for me to give them this competitive edge.
                    The goal of this project was to make a landing page for the travel agency, focusing on informing
                    clients about one of their top locations, Majorca. The base site was created, but the company needed
                    something visually appealing and user friendly.
